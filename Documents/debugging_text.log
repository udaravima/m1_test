1 Introduction
As a rapidly growing subscriber profile, M1 is looking for a state of the art, comprehensive messaging
and content delivery solution which could be used across a wide spectrum such as BAS, SMS, MMS,
USSD, SWS and WAPPUSH. The platform will be a middleware from a network point of view, from
which all relevant network elements will be interfaced as required during transactional flow. The
service delivery platform will be a single, centralized, yet modular solution designed to meet all
business requirements across many geographical regions.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this SRS is to detail the requirements of M1 with regard to the Provisioning Module of
the Service Delivery Platform that will be implemented and delivered by hSenid.
The document serves as a guide to the exact requirements for the proposed features and will be used
by hSenid engineering team to develop the product’s functional specification, detailing each
requirement and its implementation.
1.2 Project Scope
The provisioning module that is described in this document will provide service delivery of content and
charge different services rendered to/by the M1 end customers, 3rd party Service Providers that uses
M1 as a mediator.
1.2.1 Benefits of the SDP Solution
This highly flexible and scalable solution will improve the operational efficiency and
simplicity of service creation of 3rd party providers and adding new functionalities that
could bring competitive advantage to M1.
The platform will allow M1 to rapidly enhance their service offerings and deliver rich
content and applications to mobile subscribers.
It shall enable delivery and charging of different services and content to the end
customers by 3rd party Service Providers with M1 as a mediator with full control via SLA
mechanisms embedded within the solution. The process to finalise service level
agreements (SLAs) and the subsequent activation of VAS applications to make the service
available to mobile subscribers, shall be automated. This business sign­up process shall
offer significant cost savings, and reduce time to market for new services, while preserving
and maintaining the security and integrity of the core network.

web application, which will be used for registering new SPs and adding new applications for their
profiles. The comprehensive GUI based provisioning module shall enable admin users to create and
provision SP profiles with SLA(s) by providing necessary authentication details. SP users shall also be
able to make new application requests with SLA(s). Application provisioning will be handled by the
Provisioning Module, while the user accounts for accessing this module will be created and managed
via the Admin Module.
Provisioning Module shall have the following features.
Service Provider Profile Management
This shall provide functionality to carry out administration tasks such as creating, modifying, searching,
disabling and enabling SP profiles.
Application Management
This shall provide functionalities that can be performed after the SP profile is created. Once the profile
is created, SP will be able to request for one or more applications under the selected service provider.
Once the SP request for application(s), the users in each state shall be able check the SLA and proceed
with provisioning the application(s).
Users shall be able to access the Provisioning Module, with access rights varying according to their
assigned roles (Please refer Appendix C­ User Roles and Permissions for further information).

Backslashes, escapes, and quoting
The backslash character ('\') serves to introduce escaped constructs, as defined in the table above, as
well as to quote characters that otherwise would be interpreted as unescaped constructs. Thus the
expression \\ matches a single backslash and \{ matches a left brace.
It is an error to use a backslash prior to any alphabetic character that does not denote an escaped
construct; these are reserved for future extensions to the regular­expression language. A backslash
may be used prior to a non­alphabetic character regardless of whether that character is part of an
unescaped construct.
Backslashes within string literals in Java source code are interpreted as required by The Java™
Language Specification as either Unicode escapes (section 3.3) or other character escapes (section
3.10.6) It is therefore necessary to double backslashes in string literals that represent regular
expressions to protect them from interpretation by the Java bytecode compiler. The string literal "\b",
for example, matches a single backspace character when interpreted as a regular expression,
while "\\b" matches a word boundary. The string literal "\(hello\)" is illegal and leads to a compile­time
error; in order to match the string (hello) the string literal "\\(hello\\)" must be used.
Character Classes
Character classes may appear within other character classes, and may be composed by the union
operator (implicit) and the intersection operator (&&). The union operator denotes a class that
contains every character that is in at least one of its operand classes. The intersection operator denotes
a class that contains every character that is in both of its operand classes.
The precedence of character­class operators is as follows, from highest to lowest:
1 Literal escape \x
2 Grouping [...]
3 Range a-z
4 Union [a-e][i-u]
5 Intersection [a-z&&[aeiou]]
Note that a different set of metacharacters are in effect inside a character class than outside a
character class. For instance, the regular expression. loses its special meaning inside a character class,
while the expression ­ becomes a range forming metacharacter.

System Requirement Specification of SDP for M1, Singapore
Line terminators
A line terminator is a one­ or two­character sequence that marks the end of a line of the input
character sequence. The following are recognized as line terminators:
• A newline (line feed) character ('\n'),
• A carriage­return character followed immediately by a newline character ("\r\n"),
• A standalone carriage­return character ('\r'),
• A next­line character ('\u0085'),
• A line­separator character ('\u2028'), or
• A paragraph­separator character ('\u2029).
If UNIX_LINES mode is activated, then the only line terminators recognized are newline characters.
The regular expression . matches any character except a line terminator unless the DOTALL flag is
specified.
By default, the regular expressions ^ and $ ignore line terminators and only match at the beginning
and the end, respectively, of the entire input sequence. If MULTILINE mode is activated then ^ matches
at the beginning of input and after any line terminator except at the end of input. When
in MULTILINE mode $ matches just before a line terminator or the end of the input sequence.
Groups and capturing
Group number
Capturing groups are numbered by counting their opening parentheses from left to right. In the
expression ((A)(B(C))), for example, there are four such groups:
1 ((A)(B(C)))
2 (A)
3 (B(C))
4 (C)
Group zero always stands for the entire expression.
Capturing groups are so named because, during a match, each subsequence of the input sequence that
matches such a group is saved. The captured subsequence may be used later in the expression, via a
back reference, and may also be retrieved from the matcher once the match operation is complete.
Group name

M1­SDP­PRO­SRS v0.1.0

2025-08-27 10:05:38 Page 67:
System Requirement Specification of SDP for M1, Singapore
A capturing group can also be assigned a "name", a named­capturing group, and then be back­
referenced later by the "name". Group names are composed of the following characters. The first
character must be a letter.
• The uppercase letters 'A' through 'Z' ('\u0041' through '\u005a'),
• The lowercase letters 'a' through 'z' ('\u0061' through '\u007a'),
• The digits '0' through '9' ('\u0030' through '\u0039'),
A named­capturing group is still numbered as described in Group number.
The captured input associated with a group is always the subsequence that the group most recently
matched. If a group is evaluated a second time because of quantification then its previously­captured
value, if any, will be retained if the second evaluation fails. Matching the string "aba" against the
expression (a(b)?)+, for example, leaves group two set to "b". All captured input is discarded at the
beginning of each match.
Groups beginning with (? are either pure, non­capturing groups that do not capture text and do not
count towards the group total, or named­capturing group.
Unicode support
This class is in conformance with Level 1 of Unicode Technical Standard #18: Unicode Regular
Expression, plus RL2.1 Canonical Equivalents.
Unicode escape sequences such as \u2014 in Java source code are processed as described in section
3.3 of The Java™ Language Specification. Such escape sequences are also implemented directly by the
regular­expression parser so that Unicode escapes can be used in expressions that are read from files
or from the keyboard. Thus the strings "\u2014" and "\\u2014", while not equal, compile into the
same pattern, which matches the character with hexadecimal value 0x2014.
A Unicode character can also be represented in a regular­expression by using its Hex notation
(hexadecimal code point value) directly as described in construct \x{...}, for example a supplementary
character U+2011F can be specified as \x{2011F}, instead of two consecutive Unicode escape
sequences of the surrogate pair \uD840\uDD1F.
Unicode scripts, blocks, categories andbinary properties are written with the \p and \P constructs as
in Perl. \p{prop} matches if the input has the property prop, while \P{prop} does not match if the input
has that property.
Scripts, blocks, categories and binary properties can be used both inside and outside of a character
class.
Scripts are specified either with the prefix Is, as in IsHiragana, or by using the script keyword (or its
short form sc)as in script=Hiragana or sc=Hiragana.
The script names supported by Pattern are the valid script names accepted and defined
by UnicodeScript.forName.

2025-08-27 10:05:38 Page 68:
System Requirement Specification of SDP for M1, Singapore
Blocks are specified with the prefix In, as in InMongolian, or by using the keyword block (or its short
form blk) as in block=Mongolian or blk=Mongolian.
The block names supported by Pattern are the valid block names accepted and defined
by UnicodeBlock.forName.
Categories may be specified with the optional prefix Is: Both \p{L} and \p{IsL} denote the category of
Unicode letters. Same as scripts and blocks, categories can also be specified by using the
keyword general_category (or its short form gc) as in general_category=Lu or gc=Lu.
The supported categories are those of The Unicode Standard in the version specified by
the Character class. The category names are those defined in the Standard, both normative and
informative.
Binary properties are specified with the prefix Is, as in IsAlphabetic. The supported binary properties
by Pattern are
• Alphabetic
• Ideographic
• Letter
• Lowercase
• Uppercase
• Titlecase
• Punctuation
• Control
• White_Space
• Digit
• Hex_Digit
• Noncharacter_Code_Point
• Assigned
Predefined Character classes and POSIX character classes are in conformance with the
recommendation of Annex C: Compatibility Properties of Unicode Regular Expression ,
when UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS flag is specified.

6 Appendix D – Short Code and Keywords
6.1 Short Code
REQ­SHT­CDE 1: Short codes shall be used to route a request to the correct application.
REQ­SHT­CDE 2: Two types of short codes can be defined:
Shared short code– More than one application can have the same short code. In this case, the
keyword will be used to route a request to the particular application.
Exclusive short code – The short code is unique and is used by only one application in the SDP.
REQ­SHT­CDE 3: A short code can be defined per NCS.
REQ­SHT­CDE 4: The short code should be a regular expression. (Please Refer Section 3.4 Dedicated
Alias Regex Pattern Guide in Appendix A ­ Profile Attributes for further information)
Eg: 888 ***
776****
REQ­SHT­CDE 5: When requesting a new short code, the short code must not be accepted by SDP if
The new short code is a subset of the previously defined set of short codes or
A previously defined short code is a subset of the new one.
REQ­SHT­CDE 6: The short code assigned to an application shall be used in both production and testbed
environments.
REQ­SHT­CDE 7: The system should not allow to have the same keyword assigned to multiple applications
under the same short code.
Ex:
Allowed:
JOIN on 12345 → App A
JOIN on 67890 → App B
(different short code with the same keyword)
Not Allowed:
JOIN on 12345 → App A
JOIN on 12345 → App B
(same short code and the same keyword)

REQ­KEY­WRD 1: SDP shall allow configuration of a maximum of 50 keywords per short code.
REQ­KEY­WRD 2: Duplicate keywords shall not be allowed for the same short code.
REQ­KEY­WRD 3: For shared short codes, the routing of an incoming request to the correct application
shall be based on the [short code + keyword] pair.
REQ­KEY­WRD 4: For each keyword, it shall be possible to specify the charging amount.
