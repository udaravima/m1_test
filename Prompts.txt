So I will remind you again, I am building a process, flow to automate the test creation process to a given Web application using selenium and cucumber wrapped with healenium. My target is to automate this test creation and reporting using AI
So, We will get a SRS(System Requirement Specification) with fields are described with there conditions and things (See Documents/). and we will have the web URL to the application.
So we have to test each requirement for that we have to build the test cases and those gerking files in cucumber.
To make this process easy I have build a WebExtractorJSON to extract web page elements to json to Interpret by AI And Authur.py to extract tables from SRS.pdf 
And configs utils properties that we can use in common on all project 
can u help me build the process and lem me know if there is anything I am doing wrong or mistakes in the process
